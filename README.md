[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/theme-food.svg?token=eFqBQ7QeZqSCA9DcjnWC&branch=8.x-1.x)](https://travis-ci.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/theme-food)

## Requirements

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [Node.js/npm](https://nodejs.org)

## QuickStart
    npm install
    export SCHAER_BRAND='kanso|flavis'
    npm start

## Orientation

* `source/_patterns/` - contains all Pattern Lab templates and the majority of 
  the Sass files.
* `scss/` - Sass files that aren't really tied to a component, so not in the 
  above location.
* `js/` - all JS files here are transpiled by Babel and combined into a single 
  `dest/script.js` file. Please group related JS files in subdirectories. 
  **NOTICE:** All files are combined alphabetically by their path. So if you 
  need a special order, please use prefixes to move files/directories to the
  start/end of the compilation process
* `icons/src/` - all SVGs here are combined into font icons and have classes and 
  Sass mixins made for each based on file name. See `Atoms` / `Icons` in Pattern 
  Lab.
* `images/sample` - all demo image files should be located here (with 
  pattern-specific subdirectories).
* `dest/sassdoc/` - Open this in a browser to see documentation on all Sass 
  thanks to [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com).
